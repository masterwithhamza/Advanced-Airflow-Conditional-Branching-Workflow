# Advanced-Airflow-Conditional-Branching-Workflow-Project



This project showcases an advanced Apache Airflow DAG that demonstrates dynamic task branching based on randomly generated numbers. The DAG features a PythonOperator to generate a random number and uses a BranchPythonOperator to direct the workflow based on the value. If the number is less than or equal to 50, it executes a task indicating "below 50"; otherwise, it proceeds with a task for "above 50". A DummyOperator is used to join the branches and ensure smooth execution. This project serves as an excellent example of conditional logic and branching in Airflow, useful for building complex data pipelines.
